Objective:

In this challenge, you will learn the usage of the 'for' loop, which is a programming language statement 
which allows code to be repeatedly executed.

The syntax for this is:

for (<expression_1>; <expression_2>; <expression_3>)
                <statement>

expression_1 is used for intializing variables which are generally used for controlling the terminating flag for the loop.
expression_2 is used to check for the terminating condition. If this evaluates to false, then the loop is terminated.
expression_3 is generally used to update the flags/variables.

A sample loop will be:

for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) 
{
        ...
}

Task:

For each integer 'n' in the interval [a, b] (given as input):

If 1 <= n <= 9, then print the English representation of it in lowercase. That is "one" for 1, "two" for 2, and so on.
Else if n > 9 and it is an even number, then print "even".
Else if n > 9 and it is an odd number, then print "odd".

Input Format:

The first line contains an integer, 'a'. 
The second line contains an integer, 'b'.

Constraints:

1 <= a <= b <= 10^6

Output Format:

Print the appropriate English representation, even, or odd, based on the conditions described in the 'task' section.

Note: [a, b] = {x belongs to Z | a <= x <= b} = {a, a + 1, ..., b}

Sample Input:

8
11

Sample Output:

eight
nine
even
odd
