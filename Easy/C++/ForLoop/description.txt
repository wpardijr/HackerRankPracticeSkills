A for loop is a programming language statement which allows code to be repeatedly executed.

The syntax is

for ( <expression_1> ; <expression_2> ; <expression_3> )
    <statement>

expression_1 is used for intializing variables which are generally used for controlling the terminating flag for the loop.
expression_2 is used to check for the terminating condition. If this evaluates to false, then the loop is terminated.
expression_3 is generally used to update the flags/variables.

A sample loop is

for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    ...
}

In this challenge, you will use a for loop to increment a variable through a range.

Input Format:

You will be given two positive integers, a and b (a <= b), separated by a newline.

Output Format:

For each integer n in the inclusive interval [a, b]:

If 1 <= n <= 9, then print the English representation of it in lowercase. That is "one" for 1, "two" for 2, and so on.

Else if n > 9 and it is an even number, then print "even".

Else if n > 9 and it is an odd number, then print "odd".

Note: [a, b] = { x belongs to Z | a <= x <= b } = {a, a + 1, ..., b}

Sample Input:

8
11

Sample Output:

eight
nine
even
odd
